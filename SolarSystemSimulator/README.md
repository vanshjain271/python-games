# 3D Solar System Simulator

### Computer Graphics Final Project  
### Developed in Python using VPython

---

## Overview
This project is a real-time 3D Solar System Simulator that visualizes the Sun, eight planets, Pluto, moons, asteroid belt, a comet, and the International Space Station.  
It uses VPython for rendering and animation and applies core computer graphics concepts such as transformations, lighting, texture mapping, and object interaction.

The simulator includes:
- Realistic planetary revolution and rotation
- Saturn and Uranus rings with tilt
- Earth night side with city lights
- Jupiter's moons in motion
- Asteroid belt and animated comet tail
- Solar flares from the Sun
- ISS orbiting Earth
- Cinematic camera mode and interactive controls
- Optional frame capture for MP4 generation

## Features
- Real-time animated orbits and rotations
- Texture-mapped planets and galaxy background
- Day and night Earth model with lights
- Click on a planet to follow it
- Keyboard controls for camera, speed, labels, trails, and orbits
- ISS model orbiting Earth
- Comet with glowing tail
- Solar flare particle system
- Export animation to MP4 using ffmpeg
